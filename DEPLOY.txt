Creating and deploying jar files
--------------------------------

See my project dev-lib for more info.

These steps still significant:

4./ SEE BELOW...
5./ Deploy the jar to Clojars (slipset/deps-deploy)
env CLOJARS_USERNAME=cjmurphy CLOJARS_PASSWORD=CLOJARS_blahblah clj -A:deploy
6./ Use it in client project's deps.edn files rather than source code or a local root

But this is a Java source code project so we use maven to create the jar file (step 4). The mvn command I used was
`mvn repository:bundle-create` but `mvn package` should work. Check that a thin jar file with classes in it is created.
Copy it from target directory to ham.jar in root, overwriting current one that's there. Then onto step 5.

If your IDE is IntelliJ/Cursive do not tell it that this is a Clojure project - the deps.edn only exists so you can
deploy the jar to Clojars (`clj -A:deploy`) from the command line.

We are now back to 0.9.1 in pom.xml, but next deploy s/be 0.9.4, as we used up the other versions on experiments with
having ids as strings, which didn't work. So 0.9.2 and 0.9.3 exist but don't work and are never to be used.
