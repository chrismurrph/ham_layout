Creating and deploying jar files
--------------------------------

See my project dev-lib for more info.

These steps still significant:

5./ Deploy the jar to Clojars (slipset/deps-deploy)
env CLOJARS_USERNAME=cjmurphy CLOJARS_PASSWORD=CLOJARS_blahblah clj -A:deploy
6./ Use it in client project's deps.edn files rather than source code or a local root

But this is a Java source code project so we use maven to create the jar file (step 4). I couldn't find the mvn command
I used but `mvn package` should work. Whatever works to get a thin jar file with classes in it. Copy it from target directory to
ham.jar in root, overwriting current one there. Then onto step 5.

Do not tell your IDE that this is a Clojure project - the deps.edn only exists so you can clj -A:deploy from the
command line.
